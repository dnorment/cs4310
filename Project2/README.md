Project 2: Simulating Page Replacement Manager and Performance Analysis
Author: Daniel Norment
Due: 11/26/2019

Instructions:
Compile and run Main.java, which is the main driver for the program.

Output:
The program will print out the number of page faults for each algorithm (3) for each number of page frames (3,4,5,6) for each randomly generated reference string (50). After each change in the number of page frames, it will output the average number of page faults for each algorithm over the reference strings.
